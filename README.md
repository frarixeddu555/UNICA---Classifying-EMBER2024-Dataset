# UNICA---Classifying-EMBER2024-Dataset

This is the capstone project for the Machine Learning course of our Master's degree.
The project's aim was to pick a dataset from a list and design a machine learning model for classification.

Our group presented an alternative model (Random Forest) to the one used by the authors (LightGBM) for classifying EMBER2024 Dataset. 
We followed the basic workflow steps of ML system design, and finally, the performance of both models were compared.
